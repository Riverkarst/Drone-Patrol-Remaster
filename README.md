# Drone-Patrol-Remaster

This is a remaster of a project I did during my Bachelor's degree.  It is a clone of the somewhat obscure game Rocket Patrol, made in 1978 for the [APF MP-1000 game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APF-MP1000).  The original game was quite simple, but I've remade it with new features, sounds and art assets.  Made with Phaser.js.

It is now hosted on my itch.io page [here](https://riverkarst.itch.io/rocket-raider).
